= Mixture Approximation Toolbox (mixbox)

Mixture approximations are used to approximate $L^1(\mathcal D)$ functions, $\alpha: \mathcal D \rightarrow R_{\geq 0}$. Typically, the kernel is assumed to be normalized such that
\(
	\int_{\mathcal D} \alpha(t) \, \mathrm dt = 1,
\)
which presumes that the integral of $\alpha$ over the domain, $\mathcal D$, is nonzero. In some cases, e.g., if $\alpha$ is a probability density function, it is required to be non-negative:
\(
	0 \leq \alpha(t).
\)
Finally, many convergence results require $\alpha$ to be continuous. Depending on the domain, there exist the following three basic types of mixture approximations.
- [/gauss.html  Gauss mixture approximations]: $\mathcal D = (-\infty, \infty)$
- [/erlang.html Erlang mixture approximations]: $\mathcal D = [0, \infty)$
- [/beta.html   Beta mixure approximations]: $\mathcal D = [a, b]$: 

== Overview
